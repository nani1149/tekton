Workspaces in a Task
A Task utilizes a workspace as a designated location for input file reading, output file writing, and file operations within a pipeline. It offers a dedicated area within the container where the task executes, facilitating efficient data management and sharing between tasks in the pipeline.

To maintain best practices, it is recommended to use a single writable workspace in Tasks. The provided example showcases writing a message to a file, which is mounted to the task using the workspaces field within the task's specification.

spec:
  steps:
    - name: write-message
      image: ubuntu
      script: |
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        set -xe
        echo Hello! > $(workspaces.messages.path)/message
  workspaces:
    - name: messages
      description: Location to save the generated message
      mountPath: /custom/path/relative/to/root
