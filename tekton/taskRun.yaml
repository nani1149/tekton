Usage
There are two ways to specify the corresponding Task in order to execute a TaskRun. One of these ways is by providing the name of the Task in the taskRef field, as shown below:

spec:
  taskRef:
    name: read-task

The other is by passing the whole task in the taskSpec field as shown below:

spec:
  taskSpec:
    steps:
      - name: welcome
        image: ubuntu
        script:|
              echo “Welcome to tekton CI/CD”
      - name: display-readable-timestamp
        image: bash:latest
        script: |
          #!/usr/bin/env bash
          date | tee $(results.readable-timestamp.path)
